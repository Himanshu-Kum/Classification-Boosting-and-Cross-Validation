## Classification-Boosting-and-Cross-Validation

#### 1. The project has the classification techniques on two data sets from UCI Machine Learning repository.
#### 2. Classification techniques include Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Decision Trees.
#### 3. The best classification technique was chosen with highest accuracy and implemented Gradient Boosting to enhance the results.
#### 4. To reduce the biasedness from the model, Cross validation was used with the best algorithm.
